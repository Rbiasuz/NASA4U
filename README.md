# NASA4U
Code for the nasa space apps challenge 2023

## A High-Level Summary:

The process of urbanization has brought about significant changes in the natural phenomena of the planet's ecosystem. In the Year of Open Science, a data-driven strategy materializes the National Open Science Policy and promotes collaborative science by integrating data for the scientific ecosystem.

To meet this challenge, the NASA4U platform was created, incorporating a wealth of data from NASA and federal agencies in an accessible manner. It utilizes artificial intelligence to compile, process, and transform complex data into simplified information. The platform serves as an information channel for the public, accessible through an application that makes data integration straightforward for citizens.

In advanced mode, the platform's scope is expanded to cater to researchers and technicians, enabling integration with advanced geotechnology software. It also serves as a tool for scientific research and government territorial planning.


## Project Details: What exactly does the project do?

NASA4U is a citizen-oriented platform that compiles and processes various NASA and federal agency datasets, transforming scientific data into simplified information for individuals. Users can pose open-ended questions and receive direct feedback with simplified environmental information tailored to their local context.

## Example 1

A question is asked about the origin of the data in the table, the program explains the path taken to arrive at the answer, and then returns the final answer to the user:

## Example 2

A question is asked about the emission of CO, the program explains the path taken to arrive at the answer, and then returns the final answer to the user:

## Example 3

A question is asked about the average brightness and Carbon Monoxide in California, the program explains the path taken to arrive at the answer, and then returns the final answer to the user:

In advanced mode, the interface is expanded to provide integrated information within the scientific ecosystem, offering more comprehensive scientific and governmental data.

## What is expected to be achieved?

The project aims to provide environmental data to the general public and support governments and defense institutions in helping citizens access NASA and federal agency information in a simplified manner through an interface that utilizes artificial intelligence (chatbot) to respond to people's direct inquiries. For instance, during weather-related events.

In future perspectives, the familiarity with data usage allows for expanding the application to incorporate data from researchers to assist technicians and governments in data-driven decision-making through geotechnologies, especially in cases of environmental disasters affecting people in crisis situations.

As a result, the platform is expected to transition to using more advanced software by integrating data from advanced geographic information systems through geolocation tools (integrated planning maps) with OpenStreetMap and ArcGIS. This will link with future-proof geotechnology services, integrating layers of data into GIS, including collaborative mapping applications (ArcGIS Hub). Thus, the NASA4U platform enables integration with more advanced software and applications that utilize future-proof technologies, becoming a tool for scientific research and government territorial planning in service of society.
